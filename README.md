- **Data Validation:** Ensure data accuracy and completeness with required fields, date restrictions, and card number validation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

For the application to succesfully run, you need to install the following packages:

- flask (version 2.2.2)
- pyodbc (version 4.0.39)
- SQLAlchemy (version 2.0.21)
- werkzeug (version 2.2.3)

### Usage

To run the application, you simply need to run the `app.py` script in this repository. Once the application starts you should be able to access it locally at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. Here you will be meet with the following two pages:

1. **Order List Page:** Navigate to the "Order List" page to view all existing orders. Use the pagination controls to navigate between pages.

2. **Add New Order Page:** Click on the "Add New Order" tab to access the order form. Complete all required fields and ensure that your entries meet the specified criteria.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Flask is used to build the backend of the application, handling routing, data processing, and interactions with the database.

- **Frontend:** The user interface is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience.

- **Database:** The application employs an Azure SQL Database as its database system to store order-related data.

### Networking Services Deployment with Terraform

#### Overview

This repository contains Terraform configurations for deploying networking resources in Azure, including a Virtual Network (VNet), subnets, and Network Security Groups (NSGs). This README provides an overview of the networking services deployed using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform.

#### Prerequisites

Before running the Terraform configurations, ensure you have the following prerequisites set up:

Azure subscription
Azure CLI installed and configured
Terraform CLI installed

#### Terraform Configuration

1. Input Variables

   - resource_group_name: The name of the Azure resource group where networking resources will be created.
   - location: The Azure region where networking resources will be deployed.
   - vnet_address_space: The address space for the Virtual Network (VNet).

2. Networking Resources

   - Azure Resource Group
   - Virtual Network (VNet)
   - Subnets
   - Network Security Group (NSG)

3. Output Variables
   - vnet_id: ID of the Virtual Network (VNet).
   - control_plane_subnet_id: ID of the control plane subnet.
   - worker_node_subnet_id: ID of the worker node subnet.
   - resource_group_name: Name of the Azure Resource Group for networking resources.
   - aks_nsg_id: ID of the Network Security Group (NSG) for AKS.

#### Usage

1. Clone Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set Terraform Variables: Update the variables.tf file with your desired values for input variables.
3. Initialize Terraform: Run terraform init to initialize the Terraform configuration.
4. Review Execution Plan: Run terraform plan to review the execution plan and ensure it matches your expectations.
5. Apply Terraform Changes: Run terraform apply to apply the Terraform changes and deploy networking resources to Azure.

- \*\*git can only support files of a certain size & that the .terraform is larger so has to be avoided

### AKS Cluster steps with Terraform

1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/robinucar/Web-App-DevOps-Project.git
cd Web-App-Devops-Project
cd aks-terraform
cd aks-cluster-module

```

2. Define Input Variables:

   - aks_cluster_name: The name of the AKS cluster.
   - cluster_location: The Azure region where the AKS cluster will be created.
   - dns_prefix: DNS prefix for the AKS cluster.
   - kubernetes_version: The version of Kubernetes to be used.
   - service_principal_client_id: Client ID of the service principal used for authentication.
   - service_principal_client_secret: Client Secret associated with the service principal.
   - resource_group_name: Name of the Azure Resource Group for networking resources.
   - vnet_id: ID of the Virtual Network (VNet).
   - control_plane_subnet_id: ID of the control plane subnet.
   - worker_node_subnet_id: ID of the worker node subnet.

3. Define AKS Cluster Configuration:

   - Update the main.tf file to define the AKS cluster configuration using the azurerm_kubernetes_cluster resource block. Specify the desired configuration options such as name, location, DNS prefix, Kubernetes version, and service principal details.

4. Define Output Variables:
   Update the output.tf file to define output variables for the AKS cluster. The output variables include:

   - aks_cluster_name: Name of the AKS cluster.
   - aks_cluster_id: ID of the AKS cluster.
   - aks_kubeconfig: Kubeconfig file for accessing the AKS cluster.

5. Initialize Terraform:

   - Run the following command to initialize Terraform and download the required provider plugins:

   ```
   terraform init

   ```
